            <p>  <strong>"{{ title }}"</strong> system is a project of Software Engineering
                department students of Mathematics and Mechanics Faculty, St. Petersburg State University.<br>

                The purpose of the project is to acquaint the user with road accidents statistics in the regions of the Russian Federation
                 and to provide an opportunity for its visualization and comparison with road accidents statistical indicators of Finland.<br>

                On this site you can get acquainted with the road accident statistics taken from
                <a href="http://www.gibdd.ru/">Russian traffic police site</a> and
                <a href="http://www.stat.fi/index_en.html">Finland statistics site</a> in a graphical and tabular format.<br>

                Methods for visualization with descriptions and references to pages with corresponding functionality are presented below.
